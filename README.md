# Human Fitness Classification using Biometric and Strength Metrics

## Overview

This project aims to predict an individual’s fitness level (classified as A, B, or C) using biometric and strength-related measurements such as body fat percentage, blood pressure, grip strength, flexibility, and more.

The dataset represents over 13,000 individuals, containing various health indicators and performance metrics.
By leveraging machine learning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project identifies key factors that contribute to overall fitness and builds a predictive model to classify fitness levels.



## Problem Statement

How accurately can we predict a person’s fitness level based on measurable physiological and strength parameters?

**This problem is essential for**:\
	- Designing personalized training programs\
	- Monitoring health and performance progress\
	- Supporting fitness apps or wellness platforms in automated recommendations
